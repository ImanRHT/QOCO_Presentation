	\textbf{Key Contributions:}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Formulated the computation task offloading problem as a finite and discret Markov Decision Process (MDP) to maximize the expected long term QoE for each MDs.
		
		\item Proposed the QoE-oriented computation offloading (QOCO) algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to empower each MD to make offloading decisions independently.
		
		\item Conducting comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of QOCO compared with several benchmark methods.
